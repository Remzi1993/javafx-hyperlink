    # Keep JavaFX on the 24.x STABLE line for now.
    # Why: New JavaFX majors (25.x, 26.x, …) start as -ea pre-releases; we don’t want PRs for pre-releases
    # or for the next major until we explicitly decide to move.
    # The range "[25,)" means "25.0.0 and above" — i.e., ignore any update >= 25 (including 25-ea+N and future majors).
    # When ready to adopt 25.x stable, change this to "[26,)" (to stay on 25.x), or remove the rule entirely.
