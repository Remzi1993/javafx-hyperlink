# 🤝 Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing!

1. **Fork → feature branch → PR.**  
   Create a descriptive branch name (e.g. `feat: mailto and subject support`).

2. **Follow conventional commits** (`feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `chore:`, etc.).  
   See: https://www.conventionalcommits.org

3. **Quality gate:** ```./mvnw clean verify``` **must be 100% green** — no test failures, **no warnings**, and no build errors.  
   Add Javadoc for any new public APIs.

Exceptions to the “no warnings” rule are **rare** and may only be granted by the maintainers.
