Any pre‑release versions (alpha, beta, RC, snapshots) are **experimental** and receive **no support**.

**Need help?** Always upgrade to the newest stable version **before** requesting assistance. Most issues are resolved by updating.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability:

1. **Do not** open a public issue.
2. Email me privately at **ict@remzi.info**.
3. Include a clear description, reproduction steps, and the version you are using.

You will receive an initial acknowledgement within **5 business days**. If the report is valid:

- I will work on a fix and publish a new stable release.
- Once a fix is available, you may disclose the issue publicly (or I will include credit in the release notes if you wish).

If the report is rejected (e.g. expected behavior or out of scope), I will explain why.
